A powerful and intuitive calendar application built with React for efficient communication tracking. This application allows users to easily schedule, manage, and view events with seamless navigation across different time frames (monthly, weekly, and daily views).

Ideal for personal or team-based event management, the app provides a responsive interface, simple event handling, and easy-to-use features, making it perfect for keeping track of important dates and communication milestones.

Install Dependencies
We will need a few libraries like react-router-dom for routing, react-calendar for the calendar component, and react-bootstrap for UI components:
npm install react-router-dom react-calendar react-bootstrap

Install Dependencies
Inside the VS Code terminal (or your preferred terminal), navigate to the project folder if not already there and run the following command to install the required dependencies using NPM:
npm install
This command installs all the dependencies listed in the package.json file.

5. Run the Application
After installing the dependencies, you can start the React application. In the VS Code terminal, run:
npm start
This will start the React development server, and you can access the app at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
